# Rentals
Data entry automation with BeautifulSoup and Selenium for rental prices. A project that consists of two powerful tools- bs4 and Selenium. I used apartments.com and searched data for rentals in Annapolis, Maryland that are one bedrooms under $2500 and scraped this website with BeauitfulSoup. I then took the 3 lists of prices, addresses, and links and had Selenium fill out a Google Doc form I pre-created. Then, after my code was done running, I manually clicked a button on Google Docs that converts the responses to a Google Sheet. And now rental prices for the area and critiera I specified are all in one place, organized and easy to read!
